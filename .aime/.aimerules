# Project Rules

This project uses AIME for development assistance with automatic state tracking.

## Current Plan and TODOs

### Plan
## Plan for Holistic Wellness App MVP
  
  ### Approach:
  Build a mobile-first Progressive Web App (PWA) that combines biometric data, astrology, numerology, and health science into a unified wellness dashboard. The MVP will focus on core data collection, basic analysis, and actionable insights presentation.
  
  ### MVP Core Features:
  1. **User Onboarding** - Collect birth data, basic health info
  2. **Wellness Dashboard** - Unified view of all health dimensions
  3. **Data Input System** - Manual entry for biometrics, mood tracking
  4. **Astrology Integration** - Basic zodiac and planetary influences
  5. **Numerology Analysis** - Life path and personal year calculations
  6. **Health Insights** - Combine all data into actionable recommendations
  7. **Daily Guidance** - Personalized tips based on current state
  
  ### Tech Stack:
  - React + Vite (fast development)
  - Tailwind CSS (mobile-first styling)
  - Zustand (state management)
  - LocalStorage (MVP data persistence)
  - Chart.js (data visualization)
  - PWA capabilities (installable on mobile)
  
  ### TODOs:
  [ ] Set up React project with Vite and dependencies
  [ ] Create mobile-first responsive layout structure
  [ ] Build user onboarding flow (birth data, health profile)
  [ ] Implement wellness dashboard with three health dimensions
  [ ] Create biometric data input forms
  [ ] Add astrology calculation module
